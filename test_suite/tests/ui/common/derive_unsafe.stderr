error: To use derive_unsafe() function, the feature `derive_unsafe` of crate `nutype` needs to be enabled.

       DID YOU KNOW?
       It's called `derive_unsafe` because it enables to derive any traits that nutype is not aware of.
       So it is developer's responsibility to ensure that the derived traits do not create a loophole to bypass the constraints.
       As the rule of thumb avoid using `derive_unsafe` with traits that:
       - Create a new instance of the type
       - Mutate the value
